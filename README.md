## Abstract
This thesis investigates the potential effectiveness of simple temperature-related weather derivatives to hedge against the risks posed by increased climate variability in Swiss agriculture...

## Repository Structure
- `code/`: All R scripts used in the analysis
- `data/`: Temperature data (if shareable)
- `plots/`: Generated visualizations
- `results/`: Output CSV files and analytics

## Requirements
- R version 4.x
- Required packages:
  - readxl
  - dplyr
  - lubridate
  - ggplot2
  - reshape2
  - gridExtra

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Set your working directory in R
3. Ensure all required packages are installed
4. Run scripts in numerical order (01_setup_parameters.R, etc.)

## Data
